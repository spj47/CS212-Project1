            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p> Welcome to Bocconcino Hawaii, your destination for the finest selection of food and retail items. Our journey began with a passion for quality and to display authentic Italian cuisine to the people of Hawaii.</p>
            <p> We are an authentic Italian Restaurant, Deli, Mozzarella factory, and Retail store located in Oahu, Hawaii. We are the first mozzarella factory on the islands and are proud to say we can give our customers the best quality cheese. Every week we produce fresh mozzarella cheese that we display for customers to buy during open hours. Our Restaurant items are made fresh in front of you. We slice the deli meats for your pinsas and sandwiches where it’s visible to customers. We serve fresh coffee drinks at the front made with classic Italian brands like Kimbo. We also have items imported from Italy available for purchase, including pastas, sauces, snacks, candies, and much more.</p>
            <p>Chef Donato Loperfido, who is well-known for his many successful restaurants on the islands like “Donato’s” and “Pasta Basta,” has made a comeback after many years with Bocconcino Hawaii. His goal with this restaurant is to educate people on the culinary arts. "You can use simple ingredients in your dish, but what makes it good is the quality." As a man who was born and raised in Alberobello, a tiny countryside city in the southern parts of Italy, he is extremely passionate about Italian cuisine.</p>
